### PDF Generator demo.

Simple demo to show how you can create a service quickly and easily to generate PDF's from a HTML string.

Note this is missing parameter safety checks, but is a working example! If you're using postman to test it, click "save response" on the right, save the pdf and you'll see whatever html you specified in the post body - it also gets written to the root directory.
